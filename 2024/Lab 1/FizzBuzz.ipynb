    "  The FizzBuzz operation is a common programming task where you iterate over a range of numbers and perform the following actions:\n",
    "  - If the number is divisible by 3, print \"Fizz\".\n",

    "  - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\".\n",
    "  - Otherwise, print the number itself.\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  >>> fizzbuzz(15)\n",
